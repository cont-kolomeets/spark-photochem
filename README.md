# Description
The program SPARK developed in the Institute of Chemical Kinetics and Combustion SB RAS is designed for fitting of experimental kinetic curves of optical density change within a given system of differential equations. The main goal of this program is to provide a user with a powerful tool for fitting data obtained with laser flash photolysis methods. This software, using the 4th order Runge-Kutta method combined with global optimization, allows one to perform automatic fit for hundreds of input parameters of several types (rate constants, absorbance coefficients and initial concentrations).

If you publish results obtained using SPARK, you should acknowledge the source of the code. The general reference is - .
